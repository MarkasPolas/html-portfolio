 <h1>Sarune's Favorite Movies</h1>
 <h2>The movies I can watch over and over</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Pride & Prejudice</h3> 
 <p>Historical, romantic and cozy. I'm not even sure if I prefer the 2005 version or the BBC mini series.<br/>
Honestly, both are great</p>
<h3>Legally Blonde</h3> 
<p>Fun, uplifting, stylish, yet still focused on the importance of human connection</p>
<h3>Knives Out</h3>
<p>Ryan Johnson<br/>
Who doesn't enjoy a good murder mystery? Especially when it switches genres in the middle of it executes it perfectly</p>
